As the lead analyst for a New York City-based bike-sharing service, the objective of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of user behavior. This analysis will aid the business strategy department in assessing the current bike distribution logistics model across the city and identifying expansion opportunities. The goal is to derive actionable insights to address availability issues and solidify the company's position as a leader in eco-friendly transportation solutions in the city.

Context:
Utilizing public data from Citi Bike's facilities in New York, this project aims to address distribution challenges arising from the increased popularity of bike-sharing since its launch in 2013. The success of Citi Bike's marketing strategy promoting sustainable transportation has been further amplified by the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to higher demand. However, this surge in demand has resulted in distribution problems, such as bike shortages at popular stations and difficulties in returning hired bikes, leading to customer complaints.

As the lead analyst, the task involves diagnosing the root causes of distribution issues and advising higher management on potential solutions. This requires bridging the gap between divisions and ensuring that the analysis is communicated effectively to the business development team. To achieve this, insights will be presented in an interactive dashboard, highlighting key metrics essential for addressing distribution issues.
